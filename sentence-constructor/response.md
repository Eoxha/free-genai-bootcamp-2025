### Sentence Structure
For "Bears are at the door", the structure is: [Subject] は [Location] に [Verb (iru)]

Example: 熊はドアにいる (Kuma wa doa ni iru)

熊 (Kuma) = Bears
ドア (Doa) = door
いる (Iru) = to be (for living things)

For "Did your leave the garbage out?", the structure is: [Subject] は [Object] を [Verb (dasu)] か

### Clues to Solve

"Bears are at the door": Focus on the location. Think about how we express the state of something being "at" a location using に.

"Did your leave the garbage out?": Pay attention to the question format here. It's asking about an action in the past, so think about how to form a past tense question. The verb 出す (dasu) might need to be in a form that asks if something was done.
