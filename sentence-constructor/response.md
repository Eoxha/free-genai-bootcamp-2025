## Response
Great! Let’s break down the two sentences: "Bears are at the door" and "Did you leave the garbage out?"

I’ll guide you through the transcription and analysis, while sticking to the rules.

### Sentence 1: "Bears are at the door"
Step 1: Vocabulary Table

|Kanji/Hiragana | Romaji | English |
| :----- | :----- | :----- | 
| 熊 | kuma | bear |
| 扉 | tobira | door |
| いる | iru | to be (used for living things) |

Step 2: Conceptual Structure
This sentence is structured like:

Subject (noun) + Location (noun) + Verb (existence)
So, for this sentence:

熊 (bears) + 扉 (door) + いる (to be, for living things)
A more literal structure would be:

熊は (Bears are) + 扉に (at the door) + いる (exist).
The verb いる is used here because we are talking about living things (the bears). The verb いる shows the existence of the bears at the door.

### Sentence 2: "Did you leave the garbage out?"

Step 1: Vocabulary Table

| Kanji/Hiragana | Romaji | English
| :----- | :----- | :----- |
| あなた | anata | you (pronoun) |
| ゴミ | gomi | garbage |
| 出す | dasu | to put out, to take out (verb)|

Step 2: Conceptual Structure
This sentence follows the structure:

Subject (pronoun) + Object (noun) + Verb (action) + Question
For this question:

あなた (you) + ゴミ (garbage) + 出す (to put out) + (question)
A basic structure would be:

あなたは (You) + ゴミを (garbage) + 出す (put out) + か (question marker)
This question is asking if the garbage was put out, so the verb 出す is used in the dictionary form (as we're asking a question). The か at the end makes it a question.

## Issues
- Japanese vocabulary is in Kanji only.
- It provide particles 
- It provide the answer.
